• Diplomatic Immunity: By dint of your diplomatic
status, you cannot be prosecuted for crimes in nations
other than your own. All another nation can do
is deport you to your home nation.
• Security Clearance: You have access to classified
government information, installations, and possibly
equipment and personnel.
• Status: By virtue of birth or achievement, you have
special status. Examples include nobility, knighthood,
aristocracy, and so forth.
• Wealth: You have greater than average wealth or
