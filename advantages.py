be significant enough to cost at least 1 power point. An
example is Diplomatic Immunity (see Sample Benefits).
A license to practice law or medicine, on the other hand,

no significant game effect.
Benefits may come in ranks for improved levels of the

mind some qualities may constitute Benefits in some series,
but not in others, depending on whether or not they
have any real impact on the game.
Sample Benefits
The following are some potential Benefits. The GM is free
to choose any suitable Benefit for the series.
• Alternate Identity: You have an alternate identity,
complete with legal paperwork (driver’s license, birth
certificate, etc.). This is different from a costumed
identity, which doesn’t necessarily have any special
legal status (but may in some settings).
• Ambidexterity: You are equally adept using either
hand, suffering no circumstance penalty for using
your off-hand (as you don’t have one).
• Cipher: Your true history is well hidden, making it
difficult to dig up information about you. Investigation
checks concerning you are made at a –5 circumstance
penalty per rank in this benefit.
• Diplomatic Immunity: By dint of your diplomatic
status, you cannot be prosecuted for crimes in nations
other than your own. All another nation can do
is deport you to your home nation.
• Security Clearance: You have access to classified
government information, installations, and possibly
equipment and personnel.
• Status: By virtue of birth or achievement, you have
special status. Examples include nobility, knighthood,
aristocracy, and so forth.
• Wealth: You have greater than average wealth or
material resources, such as well-off (rank 1), independently
wealthy (rank 2), a millionaire (rank 3), multimillionaire
(rank 4), or billionaire (rank 5)."""
